## About
### This package is part of the [EarthMC Toolkit](https://emctoolkit.vercel.app) and provides extensive info about people, places and more on the EarthMC Minecraft server.

## Documentation
A complete class-based refactor was introduced in v6.0.0 and now requires documenting in an entirely different way than versions prior.<br>

These changes are breaking and updating is optional, though recommended. <br>
You should create a seperate branch to update your code base fully to the current version while remaining on v5.2.5 temporarily.

- [Current](https://emctoolkit.vercel.app/npm/current) ( >= v6.3.0 )
- [Deprecated](https://emctoolkit.vercel.app/npm/deprecated) ( <= 5.2.5 )
